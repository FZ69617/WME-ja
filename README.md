WME-ja
======

Waze Map Editor (WME) addon to help with junction design.
If two connected segments are selected, it shows the turn angle, otherwise the the angle between each segment.
I try to test with both Chrome and Firefox (Greasemonkey), 
but anything might break at any given time anyway :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Update 2013-06-04: And yes, something broke. Since Chrome v27 this script is not working, and the only way to currently use it is through Tampermonkey. Sorry.
